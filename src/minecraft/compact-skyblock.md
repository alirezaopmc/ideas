# Compact Skyblock
Skyblock is a style/mode of minecraft. It's one of the oldest and the most popular modes. Usually server owners and developers struggle with high resource usage of the huge skyblock farms.

## Problem

Usally players spend a lot of their time to build and scale their farms which I believe that's wasting of time. Actually I have never made a cactus farm greater than 4x4 but using Worldedit plugin ;).

## Solution

The whole idea is to handle the farm income in a thread handled by a plugin instead of letting the game mechanism to make new items like cactus. The player will be able to upgrade and scale their farm by spending credit like money or rare items.
